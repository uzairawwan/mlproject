## al the training code like how many and different model I want to use 
## I may call confusion matrix if I am problem solving the classification problem 
## If Im solving a regression problem I may call R2 score etc
## All such things are going to happen over here 
## As it is our first project, from trainer itself we are going to push the model pickle file to the cloud
