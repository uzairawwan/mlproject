## components are all the modules that we are going to create 
## initially we will create a process called data ingestion
## data ingestion means that I will be reading the dataset from a database or from some other file location
## initiallly we need to read the database, this reading of the database specifically is called data ingestion
## data ingestion is part of a module when we are developing the entire project 
## After ingestion, we try to transform the data 

## when we read the data, we divide it into train and test and this is all for the mmodel training purpose 
## we will also create the validation data
